Reading an documents in this website here is some high light that it recommanded

1. Sub sampling
    a. Reduce the resolution for the depth image in order to help with 'zero_depth' on images aka holes
    b. While this will clearly affect the depth-map xy resolution, it should be noted that all stereo algorithms do involve some convolution operations, 
    so reducing the x-y resolution after capture with modest sub-sampling (<3) will lead to fairly minimal impact to the depth x-y resolution.
    c. Often to fill the hole, we use either 'non-zero mean' or 'non-zero medium' for a pixel and nearby neighbor. It will find an zero pixel and sample
    around that pixel either replace the pixel value with the mean or medium with nearby pixel
    d. Decimation filter
